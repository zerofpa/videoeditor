Components of an AI-Driven Video Editing Tool:

    - Video Input Handling: Import and handle various video formats.
    - Scene Detection: Identify different scenes and transitions in the video.
    - Object and Face Detection: Recognize and track objects and faces.
    - Audio Analysis: Analyze and edit audio tracks, including noise reduction and speech recognition.
    - Automated Editing: Apply editing techniques like cutting, transitions, color grading, and effects based on predefined styles or AI-driven suggestions.
    = User Interface: Allow users to interact with the AI tool, providing input and adjustments as needed.

Tools and Libraries:

    - OpenCV: For computer vision tasks like scene detection and object tracking.
    - TensorFlow/Keras: For building and deploying machine learning models.
    - Librosa: For audio processing and analysis.
    - FFmpeg: For handling video and audio file operations.
    - Django/Flask: For creating a web-based user interface.
    - React/Angular: For a more interactive front-end user experience.

Example Workflow:

    - User Uploads Video: The user uploads a video file through the web interface.
    - Scene Detection: The system detects different scenes in the video.
    - Object and Face Detection: The system identifies and tracks objects and faces.
    - Audio Analysis: The system analyzes the audio track for beats, speech, and other elements.
    - Automated Editing: The AI applies editing rules to create a polished video.
    - User Adjustments: The user can review and adjust the edits through the interface.
    - Export: The final edited video is exported and made available for download.
